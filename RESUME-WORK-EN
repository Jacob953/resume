## Professional

### Huawei - 2012 Laboratory Xi'an

Software Engineer @ Gauss Lab 2022.7 - Present
- **Kernel Clipping**: Responsible for the cutting of the database kernel, pre-research the database kernel in small memory scenarios, and conserve the memory usage to 10\% of the original (from 1.6 GB cropped to 200 MB).
- **Research**: The only intern in the group who made project presentations to four project leaders at the same time and shared the research results of CCEH thesis.

### Open Source Promotion Plan - ShardingSphere Remote

Student Developer 2022.7 - 2022.7 - 2022.10
- **Engine Design**: Design a dynamic test engine for SQL parsing, load more than 110,000 SQL test samples from MySQL and PostgreSQL, and complete the parameterized test of the SQL parser within 1 minute.
- **Optimization**: Migrating test coverage reports from Travis to GitHub Action saved CI time by at least 3-5 minutes.

### CloudWeGO - Netpoll Remote

Awesome Contributor 2022.2 - 2022.7 - 2022.9
- **Design SDK**: Design a pure Golang version (without CGO) high-performance io\_uring I/O poller SDK, adopting the shared memory scheme, and implementing asynchronous I/O by designing Submit, Complete queues and memory barriers.
- **Performance**: Approximately 3 times improvement compared to epoll, implemented default POLL for poller using io\_uring.
